  # ==Example
  #   MyClass.publicize_methods do
  #     ...call some method that was private or protected...
  #   end
 
  def publicize_methods
    saved_private_instance_methods = self.private_instance_methods
    saved_protected_instance_methods = self.protected_instance_methods
    self.class_eval {
      public *saved_private_instance_methods 
      public *saved_protected_instance_methods 
    }
    yield
    self.class_eval {
      private *saved_private_instance_methods 
      protected *saved_protected_instance_methods 
    }
  end
